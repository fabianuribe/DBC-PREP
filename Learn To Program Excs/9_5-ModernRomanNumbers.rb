# Modern‚Äù Roman numerals. 
# 
# Eventually, someone thought it would be ter- ribly clever if putting a smaller number before a larger one meant you had to subtract the smaller one. 
# As a result of this development, you must now suffer. 
# Rewrite your previous method to return the new-style Roman numerals so when someone calls roman_numeral 4, it should return 'IV'.
# For reference, these are the values of the letters used:
# I = 1 V = 5 X = 10 L = 50 C = 100 D = 500 M = 1000
